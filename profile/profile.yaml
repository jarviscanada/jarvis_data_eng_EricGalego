summary: >
  Hi, I'm Eric a computer science specialist graduate from the University of Toronto. I began my software journey in
  high school developing and working with small applications to make my day-to-day life easier. From there I knew I
  wanted to continue my education in the direction of technology as I enjoyed working with new technologies and 
  automating things I found to be tedious. To accomplish this I utilized numerous technologies such as Python, 
  JavaScript, Jenkins, AWS services, and incorporated various third party libraries and APIs. I have a background in
  security from my first job in tech as an Application Security Analyst and am looking forward to utilizing and 
  expanding my skills and knowledge from school and the industry to make me an asset to any future company I work with.
  I am an energetic and collaborative professional, eager to continue my journey in the tech industry, and keen on 
  advancing my skills. Lastly, I bring a very positive and enthusiastic attitude to any workplace I join.

    description: >
      Designed and developed an application to collect and monitor hardware data and machine resource data on designated
      host machines, leveraging a combination of Bash scripting, Docker, crontab, and PostgreSQL. It allows users in 
      charge of the cluster of Linux machines to easily access usage statistics from the PSQL database and utilize SQL
      queries to collect important statistics such as the average amount of idle CPU time across various machines over
      select periods.
  - name: "Java Grep Application"
    git_url: "/core_java/grep"
    description: >
      Designed and developed an application to mimic the functionality of the grep command line utility in Linux.
      This project is designed to collect and report lines that match a specified regex recursively in a
      provided directory. The application leverages a combination of Java 8, Docker, streams/lambdas,
      regex, and SLF4j. This provides users with a quick and efficient way to locate and extract information 
      from large sets of text-based data.
  - name: "Java Stockquote Application"
    git_url: "/core_java/stockquote"
    description: >
      Designed and developed an application that allows users to buy and sell stocks through a CLI to

      empowering users to make buying or selling decisions based on the latest market information. 
      New data about stocks are updated in a PSQL database as well as the users current stock wallet. 
      This application leverages a combination of Java 8, JDBC, PostgreSQL, Docker, Maven as well as
      JUnit and Mockito for testing.
