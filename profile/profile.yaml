summary: >
  Hi, I'm Eric a computer science specialist graduate from the University of Toronto. I began my software journey in
  high school developing and working with small applications to make my day-to-day life easier. From there I knew I
  wanted to continue my education in the direction of technology as I enjoyed working with new technologies and 
  automating things I found to be tedious in my day-to-day life. I have a background in security from my first job in
  tech as an Application Security Analyst and am looking forward to utilizing and expanding my skills and knowledge 
  from school and the industry to make me an asset to any future company I work with. I am an energetic and 
  collaborative professional, eager to enter the tech industry, and keen on advancing my skills. I bring a positive and
  enthusiastic attitude to any workplace I join.

    description: >
      Designed and developed an application to collect and monitor hardware data and machine resource data on designated
      host machines, leveraging a combination of Bash scripting, Docker, crontab, and PostgreSQL. Using Bash, our 
      host_info bash script gathers crucial hardware information while host_usage collects host resource usage data to
      constantly check how the system is performing. Docker is employed for containerization, ensuring portability and
      scalability of the application across various environments. PostgreSQL is hosted within the Docker container to
      store the results of this data collection. The continuous monitoring process through crontab checks usage 
      statistics on host machines, providing real-time insights into resource utilization. It allows users in charge of
      the cluster of Linux machines to easily access usage statistics from the PSQL database and utilize SQL queries to
      collect important statistics such as the average amount of idle CPU time across various machines over select
      periods.
