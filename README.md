# Eric Galego . Jarvis Consulting

Hi, I'm Eric a computer science specialist graduate from the University of Toronto. I began my software journey in high school developing and working with small applications to make my day-to-day life easier. From there I knew I wanted to continue my education in the direction of technology as I enjoyed working with new technologies and  automating things I found to be tedious. To accomplish this I utilized numerous technologies such as Python,  JavaScript, Jenkins, AWS services, and incorporated various third party libraries and APIs. I have a background in security from my first job in tech as an Application Security Analyst and am looking forward to utilizing and  expanding my skills and knowledge from school and the industry to make me an asset to any future company I work with. I am an energetic and collaborative professional, eager to continue my journey in the tech industry, and keen on  advancing my skills. Lastly, I bring a very positive and enthusiastic attitude to any workplace I join.
